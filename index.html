				<h3>Afghanistan’s Viral Supercar Makes Global Debut at Doha Show</h3>
				<p>At first glance, the Simurgh resembles the Batmobile. Black, low-slung with flared wheel arches, the supercar looks built for speed. Look a bit closer though, and it’s clear this car is different to the dozens of other vehicles on display at the Doha edition of the Geneva International</p>

						<p>The Corolla engine has been modified in such a way that “if you increase the speed, it’s powerful enough to take it,” Ghulam Haidar Shahamat, the head of Afghanistan Technical Vocational Institute (ATVI), told Afghanistan’s TOLO News at the time of the launch. Entop collaborated with ATVI to produce Mada 9.</p>

						<p>Entop is keeping its supercar’s price under wraps. It is also being tight-lipped on the vehicle’s performance data. It hasn’t set a timeframe for Mada 9's mass production either.</p>
